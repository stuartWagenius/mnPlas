The Emerging Taxonomy Field are tentative new names based on recent research (such as the Violets based on work of Harvey Ballard).  Some of these may not be perfectly matched and we are not ‘officially’ using these names yet.  The list also includes the name from Gleason and Cronquist in case any are head scratchers.
